## The Problem

Most projects fail ([~75%](https://web.archive.org/web/20230608090039/https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/DemoPRBR.pdf)). They fall short in terms of deadlines, budget, or scope. They fail to satisfy stakeholder requirements, and they struggle to generate value. The source of these setbacks frequently traces back to requirements. As the bedrock of any project, requirements are crucial; however, they are frequently inadequately defined, misunderstood, or mishandled. This results in ambiguity, miscommunication, and discord, ultimately leading to project failure.

Formal methods for requirements engineering exist, but they are often overlooked or underutilized. This is due to a lack of awareness, training, or easy to use tools. As a result, many projects proceed without a structured approach to requirements, leading to the aforementioned issues.

## Vision

The future of human endeavors must be built upon a foundation of structured requirements, empowering us to transform ambiguity into clarity and chaos into coherence. In this world requirements serve as the guiding pillars for all endeavors, shaping success with precision and purpose. They will drive strategic direction, innovation, and success, shaping the future with clarity, coherence, and confidence.

## Mission

Our mission is to empower individuals and organizations to embrace structured requirements as the cornerstone of success in their endeavors. Through innovative tools, comprehensive training, and expert support, we enable our users to transform ambiguity into clarity and chaos into coherence. We are committed to providing a platform where requirements serve as the guiding pillars for strategic direction, innovation, and success, driving tangible outcomes with clarity, coherence, and confidence. Our goal is to envangelize a new standard where structured requirements shape the future of human endeavors, unlocking potential and driving progress worldwide.

## Solution

We are creating a platform, `Cathedral`, that offers a full array of tools for requirements engineering. This platform will allow users to seamlessly collect, solicit, analyze, refine, and oversee requirements. It will cater to the entire requirements journey, from inception to implementation, and provide various features to ensure clarity, consistency, and alignment. By
leveraging bleeding-edge research in the field of requirements engineering and incorporating the
hard-earned lessons from industry, we aim to provide a platform that is both comprehensive and
user-friendly. Unlike existing tools, `Cathedral` will be designed to support a view model of requirements, allowing users to see requirements from their chosen perspective while allowing others to see them from theirs.
