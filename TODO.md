The destiny of systems is to be founded upon requirements

The heart of every project are requirements. Why are they not first class citizens?

The future of systems is to be the side effect of requirements. 
Requirements are the language of the system. The requirements are the system

Requirements are the control theory of systems.

The destiny of systems is to be grounded in requirements.

The heart of systems are requirements. Through its beat the system lives.
