We are creating a platform, `Cathedral`, that offers a full array of tools for requirements engineering. This platform will allow users to seamlessly collect, solicit, analyze, refine, and oversee requirements. It will cater to the entire requirements journey, from inception to implementation, and provide various features to ensure clarity, consistency, and alignment. By
leveraging bleeding-edge research in the field of requirements engineering and incorporating the
hard-earned lessons from industry, we aim to provide a platform that is both comprehensive and
user-friendly. Unlike existing tools, `Cathedral` will be designed to support a view model of requirements, allowing users to see requirements from their chosen perspective while allowing others to see them from theirs.
